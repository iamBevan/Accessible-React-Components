# Button

A `Button` that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog,
canceling an action, or performing a delete operation. It follows
[WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button)

## Installation

<Code code={codeSnippets.ButtonInstall} language='text' />

## Usage

<ComponentWrapper>
	<ButtonComponent text='Button' />
</ComponentWrapper>
<Code code={codeSnippets.Button} language='javascript' />

## Accessibility

A [button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button) is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event,
such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an
action, or performing a delete operation. A common convention
for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append
"…" (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., "Save as…".

In addition to the ordinary button widget, <Abbr text="WAI-ARIA" title='Accessible Rich Internet Applications'/> supports
2 other types of buttons:

-   Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). To tell assistive technologies
    that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute [aria-pressed](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button).
    For example, a button labelled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true.
    **Important:** it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state
    is true, the label remains "Mute" so a screen reader would say something like "Mute toggle button pressed". Alternatively,
    if the design were to call for the button label to change from "Mute" to "Unmute," the [aria-pressed](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-haspopup) attribute would not be needed.

-   Menu button: as described in the menu button pattern, a button is revealed to assistive technologies as a
    [menu button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menubutton) if it has the property aria-haspopup set to either <Code code='menu' basic={{ hasBorder: true, hasColor: false }} /> or <Code code='true' basic={{ hasBorder: true, hasColor: false }}/>.
