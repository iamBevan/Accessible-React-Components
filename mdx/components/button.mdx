# Button

A `Button` that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog,
canceling an action, or performing a delete operation. It follows
[WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#button)

## Installation

<Code code={codeSnippets.ButtonInstall} language='text' />

## Usage

<ComponentWrapper>
	<ButtonComponent text='Button' />
</ComponentWrapper>
<Code code={codeSnippets.Button} language='javascript' />

## Accessibility

A [button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button) is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event,
such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an
action, or performing a delete operation. A common convention
for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append
"…" (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., "Save as…".

In addition to the ordinary button widget, <Abbr text="WAI-ARIA" title='Accessible Rich Internet Applications'/> supports
2 other types of buttons:

-   Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed). To tell assistive technologies
    that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute [aria-pressed](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button).
    For example, a button labelled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true.
    **Important:** it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes. In this example, when the pressed state
    is true, the label remains "Mute" so a screen reader would say something like "Mute toggle button pressed". Alternatively,
    if the design were to call for the button label to change from "Mute" to "Unmute," the 
    [aria-pressed](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-haspopup) attribute would not be needed.

-   Menu button: as described in the menu button pattern, a button is revealed to assistive technologies as a
    [menu button](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menubutton) if it has the property aria-haspopup set to either <Code code='menu' basic={{ hasBorder: true, hasColor: false }} /> or <Code code='true' basic={{ hasBorder: true, hasColor: false }}/>.

### Keyboard Interaction

When the button has focus:

-   <Kbd text="Space" /> or <Kbd text="Enter" />: Activates the button.
    <ComponentWrapper>
	    <ButtonComponent text='Button' />
    </ComponentWrapper>

-   Following button activation, focus is set depending on the type of action the button performs. For example:

    -   If activating the button opens a dialog, the focus moves inside the dialog. (see [dialog pattern](/components/modal))

    -   If activating the button closes a dialog, focus typically returns to the button that opened the dialog unless the 
        function performed in the dialog context logically leads to a different element. For example, activating a cancel 
        button in a dialog returns focus to the button that opened the dialog. However, if the dialog were confirming the 
        action of deleting the page from which it was opened, the focus would logically move to a new context.

    -   If activating the button does not dismiss the current context, then focus typically remains on the button after 
        activation, e.g., an Apply or Recalculate button.

    -   If the button action indicates a context change, such as move to next step in a wizard or add another search 
        criteria, then it is often appropriate to move focus to the starting point for that action.
    
    -   If the button is activated with a shortcut key, the focus usually remains in the context from which the shortcut 
        key was activated. For example, if <Kbd text="Alt + U" /> were assigned to an "Up" button that moves the currently 
        focused item in a list one position higher in the list, pressing <Kbd text="Alt + U" /> when the focus is in the 
        list would not move the focus from the list.
